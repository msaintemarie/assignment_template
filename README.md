# assignment_template
This is the template that will be used to complete the different assignments for this course.

This repo is empty, so you'll need to fill it up yourself. The first thing you need to do is to create a folder structure. You can start by creating a folder for the first assignment. You are free to choose the name you want, but remember that you won't be the only ones accessing it, so make sure everybody will know where to look for when the time comes. Also, each assignment will include different types of files, so we highly recommend you create appropriate subfolders for each assignment. A good reference to that effect can be found [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510#sec009):

To create a folder from the repository home page, click on the "add file" button and type the name of the folder you wish to create, followed by "/.gitkeep".
